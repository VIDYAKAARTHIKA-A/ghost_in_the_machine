# Task 1: The Fingerprint Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive statistical analysis of three text classes to prove they are mathematically distinct:

- **Class 1: Human Authors** - Original texts from human authors
- **Class 2: AI Neutral** - AI-generated text on the same topics (neutral style)
- **Class 3: AI Styled** - AI-generated text mimicking the author's style

## 1. Lexical Richness Analysis

### Type-Token Ratio (TTR)
Measures vocabulary diversity (unique words / total words).

| Class | TTR | Interpretation |
|-------|-----|----------------|
| Class 1 (Human) | 0.2592 | Higher diversity - more varied vocabulary |
| Class 2 (AI Neutral) | 0.2130 | Variable |
| Class 3 (AI Styled) | 0.2498 | Attempting to match human variety |

**Key Finding:** Human text shows richer vocabulary diversity

### Hapax Legomena
Words that appear exactly once (marker of creativity and vocabulary range).

| Class | Hapax Count | Hapax % |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Class 1 (Human) | 845 | 65.20% |
| Class 2 (AI Neutral) | 477 | 44.79% |
| Class 3 (AI Styled) | 733 | 58.69% |

**Key Finding:** Humans use more unique words, showing creative vocabulary

---

## 2. Syntactic Complexity Analysis

### Adjective-to-Noun Ratio
Measures descriptive tendency (AI often over-describes).

| Class | Adj/Noun Ratio | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Class 1 (Human) | 0.4792 | Balanced description |
| Class 2 (AI Neutral) | 0.5080 | Over-describing |
| Class 3 (AI Styled) | 0.4808 | Mimicking human pattern |

**Key Finding:** AI text shows more adjectives per noun (over-description)

### Dependency Tree Depth
Measures sentence nesting complexity.

| Class | Avg Depth | Interpretation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Class 1 (Human) | 6.78 | Complex nested structures |
| Class 2 (AI Neutral) | 7.12 | Variable |
| Class 3 (AI Styled) | 7.11 | Matching human complexity |

### Average Sentence Length

| Class | Words/Sentence |
|-------|----------------|
| Class 1 (Human) | 23.2 |
| Class 2 (AI Neutral) | 25.7 |
| Class 3 (AI Styled) | 55.4 |

---

## 3. Punctuation Density Analysis

### Key Punctuation Marks (per 1000 characters)

| Punctuation | Class 1 | Class 2 | Class 3 |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Comma | 15.80 | 15.44 | 17.23 |
| Period | 7.03 | 5.27 | 2.66 |
| Semicolon | 2.23 | 0.04 | 0.65 |
| Exclamation | 0.63 | 0.00 | 0.16 |

**Key Finding:** Each class shows distinct punctuation "signature"

---

## 4. Readability Analysis

### Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level

| Class | Grade Level | Interpretation |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Class 1 (Human) | 10.6 | High school level |
| Class 2 (AI Neutral) | 19.8 | Variable |
| Class 3 (AI Styled) | 25.7 | Different complexity |

---

## 5. Statistical Significance

### Distinctiveness Score
Based on the variance across all metrics, we can calculate how distinct these classes are:

```
Metric Variance (higher = more distinct):
- TTR: 19.2%
- Hapax %: 36.3%
- Adj/Noun: 5.9%
- Tree Depth: 4.9%
```

---

## 6. Conclusions

### Are the classes mathematically distinct?

**YES** - The three classes show measurable differences across multiple dimensions:

1. **Lexical Level**: Human text demonstrates higher vocabulary diversity
2. **Syntactic Level**: Different complexity patterns in sentence structure
3. **Punctuation Level**: Each class has a unique punctuation fingerprint
4. **Readability Level**: Distinct grade level patterns

### Key Discriminating Features

The most distinctive features for classification:
1. Type-Token Ratio (TTR)
2. Hapax Legomena percentage
3. Adjective-to-Noun ratio
4. Punctuation density patterns

### Recommendations for Classification Model

Based on this analysis, the following features should be prioritized in your classifier:
- Lexical richness metrics (TTR, Hapax)
- Syntactic complexity (dependency depth, POS ratios)
- Punctuation fingerprints
- Readability scores
