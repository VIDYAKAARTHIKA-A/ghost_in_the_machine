DICKENS_TEMPLATE = """
Continue the narrative in the style of Charles Dickens' David Copperfield.

Topic: {TOPIC}

Write ONE paragraph (100-150 words) that:
- Continues the story naturally
- Matches Dickens' narrative voice from David Copperfield
- Uses first-person perspective when appropriate
- Includes Victorian-era vocabulary naturally (don't overdo it)
- Balances long and short sentences
- Focuses on storytelling, not showcasing style

Write as if you ARE Dickens writing another chapter, not as if you're 
IMITATING Dickens.

Output only the paragraph, no preamble or title.
