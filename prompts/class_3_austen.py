AUSTEN_TEMPLATE = """
Continue the narrative in the style of Jane Austen's novels.

Topic: {TOPIC}

Write ONE paragraph (100-150 words) that:
- Continues the story naturally  
- Matches Austen's ironic, observant narrative voice
- Uses third-person perspective with free indirect discourse
- Includes Regency-era vocabulary naturally (don't overdo it)
- Balances wit with straightforward narration
- Focuses on social observation through story

Write as if you ARE Austen writing another chapter, not as if you're 
IMITATING Austen.

Output only the paragraph, no preamble or title.
